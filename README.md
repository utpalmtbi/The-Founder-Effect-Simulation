# The-Founder-Effect-Simulation
This repository contains an R script for simulating and visualizing the founder effect over multiple generations. The founder effect is a phenomenon in population genetics where a new population is established by a small number of individuals, leading to reduced genetic variation. This tool helps to understand the dynamics of allele frequency changes due to random genetic drift.

## Features
- Simulates allele frequency changes in a founding population.
- Tracks the frequencies of two alleles (`A1` and `A2`) over multiple generations.
- Visualizes the dynamics of the founder effect through interactive plots.

## Requirements
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- Required R package: `ggplot2`

To install `ggplot2`, use:
```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
